Power Reactor(inside of telvanni quarter)
    Powers the vault. Allows the candles and torches to burn indefnitly, without having to be replaced. Provides magic beyond normal ability.


Training Area: A area where the player and NPCs may train with bows, swords. Has dummies, targets.



MECHANICS:
    While inside the vault, the player's reputation and bounty will be separate. It will be zero when first entering.

    Until they have enough reputation, the player will be required to give up their items, and not take any items out. 

    There is a library, the player may take books, but is encouraged to return them to the librarian. When they do so, the books will be automatically returned to the original places.

    The vault door is not openable from the outside. It may be opened by requesting through the speaking tube, or by the vault inhabitants seeing the player approach.

    There is a magical crystal ball in a room near the vault door. It allows the user to see outside of the vault, through the eyes of the statues in the area outside. This allows the vault to stay isolated, while still being secure, and allowing the player to come and go.

    After a quest, the player may have a player home. Each room can have several layouts/configurations. The home comes with a slave/servent, who helps with this. The player can use an item sorter. It may also allow the player to have a soul bank, which can hold an unlimited number of souls, with a nice UI to list them, and retrieve them. Putting souls into the soul bank will return the empty soul gems(perhaps with a chance of losing the gem)

    NPC Scheduling: NPCs will work at their assigned post during work hours, then spend their off time praying, eating, sleeping. Ideally, they would be animated sitting, laying down. This is possible but I had some trouble with them showing the animation when not expected. Some posts may need multiple NPCs to cover the post 24/7

    Combat/Arena: A battleground, that would allow you to either have NPCs team up with each other, and play games/fake combat with each other. Some sort of capture the flag. Might also have the option to summon daedra to fight.


    Wasteland: The player can choose to allow the apocolpyse to happen. This will make vvardenfell uninabitable. All(most?) human life on the island outside of the vault is removed. NPCs are removed, or replaced with corpus monsters. Buildings have their lightes removed/extinguised, items are removed randomly, tomb/cave/spooky sound markers are placed. Weather is forced to be blight in all regions.

Possible Quests:
    Solve the murder of one of the vault residents

    Provide books, treasures to the librarian that they are missing

    Repair the summoner

    Upgrade the reactor

    New home for a mudcrab: The Mudcrab merchant is wanting to live somewhere safer. The player offers them the vault's farm, and if the vault and mudcrab agree, the player can lead/carry the mudcrab merchent into the vault, and have him live with the rest of the domesticated mudcrabs.

    Evil ending: Destory the vault(using the reactor?), or murder the residents and allow another faction to inhabit it. Vampires, perhaps.

## Quest Line: Resdaynia Vault

### Quest 1: A friend in need
- Description: Gilvas Barelo, the lead Dissident Priest, recieved a message from a long lost friend of his. I am to visit Andelor Ancestral Tomb, south of Vos and west of Indoryan.
- Steps: Complete the puzzle in the bottom of the tomb, outside of the vault door. Once the puzzle is completed, the speaking tube is revealed. You speak the code word, and the vault inhabitants open the door allowing you in. They require you to leave any posessions outside of the vault(or near the entrance inside), for their security. You are allowed into the vault. You will not be permitted to leave until you have completed the desired task.
- Reward: Unlocks the entrance to the Resdaynia Vault.

### Quest 2: Prove yourself
- Description: I've met Varon Givyn(Placeholder), the archcanon and leader of the vault. He would like me to complete a few errands for some of the residents in the vault, to familarize myself with the vault, and help them get to know me.
- Objective: Complete a certain number of the following chores.
    - Deliver a potion to a sick resident in the Redoran Dormitory, bring it from the Healer in the Temple
    - Return an overdue book a guard in the entry way has not been able to return.
    - Practice sword fighting with a young guard in the Telvanni guard quarters
    - Help custodian replace broken magical candles
    - Harvest some plants in the garden
    (If the murder happens next, make sure the murdered person is one of the residents we help)
- Reward: Services may now be provided in the vault.

### Quest 3: Growing Pains
- Description: Archcanon Givyn tells me that the vault has finished its trial run, but they need to expand certain areas, such as housing and food supply. They need to start a kwama mine, but will need a kwama queen. He has some starting point ideas, but since he hasn't been to the surface in 50 years, knows this will be of limited help.
Concern: Kwama mine is likely the best source of food. It's unlikely they wouldn't have had this to begin with. Perhaps expansion should focus on the mudcrabs, or guars.
